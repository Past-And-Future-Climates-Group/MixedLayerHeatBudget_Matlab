# Mixed-Layer Heat Budget Decomposition (Matlab-based)

This is a set of codes which calculates the Reynolds-decomposed mixed-layer heat budget for an input set of climate model data. 

This uses the formulation of Graham et al.: Climate Dynamics (2014) 43:2399â€“2414, and is the same code which was used in 
Stevenson et al: 2017 Climate Dynamics, 52, pp.7359-7374.
